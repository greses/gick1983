However, a rebel wanted to capture the dictator's fortress. He seemed confident that he could do so with his army. However, when he got to the fortress he realized that there were mines along the way to the fortress. So instead of bringing his mass army together, he organized smaller groups in order to meet up near the fortress so the mines would set off. After that, he successfully took the dictator's fortress.","Mr. Johnson's shed was burning and the townspeople were panicking. They each tried to stop the fire with a bucket of water, but each time someone threw water at the fire, it would just come back. Nothing seem to be working. The fire chief at some point came by and organized everyone together. He told everyone to get a bucket of water and wait in a circle around the shed until everyone was there. Then, he ordered everyone to throw their bucket of water and the fire went out. In the end, they ended up promoting the fire chief.",Intermediate,They were both about ways that force can be used when there is some sort of obstacle of using all of the force directly.,Moderately Agree,,,,,,"I would gauge the nature of the tumor and see exactly what the situation. Afterwards, I would calibrate the x-ray in order to get rid of the tumor while not hurting any healthy tissue if at all possible.","I would see how much of the tumor needs to be destroyed in order to completely get rid of it. Afterwards, I would devise a plan in order to make smaller pulses or x-rays that eventually get rid of the tumor.",Male,,Non-Hispanic White or Euro-American,25 - 34,Thank you for giving me the opportunity to participate in this study.410,12/5/18 15:59," The fire seemed to evaporate each bucket of water before it hit the wood. It looked like the house was doomed. Just then the fire chief arrived. He immediately took charge and organized everyone.the dictator needed to move his troops and workers to and from the fortress. However, any large force would detonate the mines. Not only would this blow up the road, but it would also destroy many neighboring villages","The fire seemed to evaporate each bucket of water before it hit the wood. It looked like the house was doomed. Just then the fire chief arrived. He immediately took charge and organized everyone. He had everyone fill their bucket and then wait in a circle surrounding the burning shed. As soon as the last man was prepared, the chief gave a shout and everyone threw their bucket of water at the tire.",Good," The force of all the water together dampened the fire right down, and it was quickly brought under control",Agree,,,,,,"A system of representation for analogy must be able to describe afundamental property of such relational systems, namely, that analogy maybe defined at multiple levels of abstraction. For example, at a relatively lowlevel of abstraction the Attack-Dispersion story and the radiation problemhave a variety of corresponding"," the rays reach the tumor all at once at a sufficiently high intensity, the tumor will be destroyed. Unfortunately, at this intensity the healthy tissue that the rays pass through on the way to the tumor will also be destroyed. ",Female,,Non-Hispanic White or Euro-American,25 - 34,awesome survey 635,12/5/18 16:08,,,,,,A general wanted to overthrow a dictator and had his men split into small groups to converge on the dictator. He had to split his men because the dictator rigged the roads to only let small groups pass.,The fire chief had people line up in a circle around a burning building and throw their bucket of water at the same time in order to put out the fire.,Good,Both required doing something at the same time and converging on a target to achieve the desired result. ,Agree,Lower intensity rays can be positioned to converge on the unhealthy tissue but positioned around it so that no two ray impacts healthy tissue.,The low rays can be positioned surrounding the unhealthy tissue so that the ray converges on the affected tissue but does not harm the healthy tissue.,Male,,Non-Hispanic White or Euro-American,25 - 34,1051,12/5/18 16:10,,,,,,The general wanted to attack a fortress to overthrow an evil dictator. The fortress was surrounded by villages and the dictator had mined the roads so that no large group of men could pass over them without setting off the mines and destroying the villages. The general divided up his army and each small group of men used a separate road to arrive at the fortress; by making sure all the men arrived at the same time the general had a large enough force to defeat the dictator and destroy his fortress.,"Mr. Johnson's house caught on fire; he sounded an alarm and his neighbors came running; each with a bucket. Mr. Johnson lived by a lake, so there was plenty of water, but the individual buckets of water could not knock down the blaze. When the fire chief arrived, he organized the neighbors so that they all threw their buckets of water on the fire at once and were able to extinguish the blaze and save the house. The townspeople were happy with him and gave him a raise.",Good,The two stories both involved organizing groups of people to achieve a common goal.,Agree,"Send multiple rays of small amounts so that the outer tissue is not damaged but, because the rays all arrive at once, the tumor will be destroyed.",Set small amounts of rays that will not harm the outer tissue to arrive all at once so that the tumor is destroyed.,Male,,Non-Hispanic White or Euro-American,55 - 64,"All was good, thanks."641,12/5/18 16:14,one night a fire out in  to wooden shed  full of timber on and the thiefe will enter the house to collect some things the fire seemed to evapourate of water the force of all water through  damped the fire right right now,one of the thiefe will enter to our house and he saw a some fire will evapourate in house and he should try to stop a fire with some water,Intermediate,they are similar to some fire and safety  situtation ,Moderately Disagree,,,,,,destory to turmor,some high intensity turmor problem and healthy issues,Male,,South Asian or Indian American,25 - 34,good447,12/5/18 16:30,"The general needed to invade a fortress in order to overthrow a dictator, but with a large army it would trigger the mine defense that the dictator had built around his fortress. So, in order to succeed the General decided to send many small forces to invade from different roads rather than send one large force and trigger the mines.",The Fire Chief in order to stop a fire basically organized citizens to circle around the fire and simultaneous dump their buckets of water onto the fire.,Good,In both stories it involved individuals or small groups of people working together to have have the same effect as one large cohesive group of people.,Agree,,,,,,"Perhaps small burst of high intensity rays, allowing the healthy tissue to recover, but gradually destroying the unhealthy tissue.","Small bursts of high intensity rays which would slowly destroy the tumor, but between each burst allowing the healthy tissue to recover.",Male,,"Black, Afro-Caribbean, or African American",25 - 34,545,12/5/18 16:37,,,,,,"There was a fortress in the middle of a small country ruled by a dictator.

Someone decided to assault the fortress but did it in small groups in order to avoid the mines going off.",Fire started in a man's shed. People threw buckets of water on it but it wouldn't go out. Fire chief arrived and had everyone throw their buckets of water at once to extinguish the fire.,Good,"Not a lot of time was given to do this survey. Five minutes left and I'm moving at a fast pace. Anyways, they were similar because a clever solution had to come about to solve the problem. Something outside of the box.",Moderately Agree,How would I know? And in under 3 minutes? Sigh. A better procedure then the one described above. Chemo?,Maybe open up the stomach surgically then ray-gun that tumor.,Female,,Non-Hispanic White or Euro-American,35 - 44,Not enough time given to do this without stressing out. :)
