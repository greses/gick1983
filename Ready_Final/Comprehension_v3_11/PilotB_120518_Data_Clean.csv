Afterwards, I would calibrate the x-ray in order to get rid of the tumor while not hurting any healthy tissue if at all possible.",0,"I would see how much of the tumor needs to be destroyed in order to completely get rid of it. Afterwards, I would devise a plan in order to make smaller pulses or x-rays that eventually get rid of the tumor.",1,Male,,Non-Hispanic White or Euro-American,25 - 34112,1,Good," The force of all the water together dampened the fire right down, and it was quickly brought under control",Poor,"A system of representation for analogy must be able to describe afundamental property of such relational systems, namely, that analogy maybe defined at multiple levels of abstraction. For example, at a relatively lowlevel of abstraction the Attack-Dispersion story and the radiation problemhave a variety of corresponding",0," the rays reach the tumor all at once at a sufficiently high intensity, the tumor will be destroyed. Unfortunately, at this intensity the healthy tissue that the rays pass through on the way to the tumor will also be destroyed. ",0,Female,,Non-Hispanic White or Euro-American,25 - 34113,2,Good,Both required doing something at the same time and converging on a target to achieve the desired result. ,Poor ,Lower intensity rays can be positioned to converge on the unhealthy tissue but positioned around it so that no two ray impacts healthy tissue.,1,The low rays can be positioned surrounding the unhealthy tissue so that the ray converges on the affected tissue but does not harm the healthy tissue.,1,Male,,Non-Hispanic White or Euro-American,25 - 34114,2,Good,The two stories both involved organizing groups of people to achieve a common goal.,Poor ,"Send multiple rays of small amounts so that the outer tissue is not damaged but, because the rays all arrive at once, the tumor will be destroyed.",1,Set small amounts of rays that will not harm the outer tissue to arrive all at once so that the tumor is destroyed.,1,Male,,Non-Hispanic White or Euro-American,55 - 64115,1,Intermediate,they are similar to some fire and safety  situtation ,Poor ,destory to turmor,0,some high intensity turmor problem and healthy issues,0,Male,,South Asian or Indian American,25 - 34116,1,Good,In both stories it involved individuals or small groups of people working together to have have the same effect as one large cohesive group of people.,Poor ,"Perhaps small burst of high intensity rays, allowing the healthy tissue to recover, but gradually destroying the unhealthy tissue.",1,"Small bursts of high intensity rays which would slowly destroy the tumor, but between each burst allowing the healthy tissue to recover.",1,Male,,"Black, Afro-Caribbean, or African American",25 - 34117,2,Good,"Not a lot of time was given to do this survey. Five minutes left and I'm moving at a fast pace. Anyways, they were similar because a clever solution had to come about to solve the problem. Something outside of the box.",Poor ,How would I know? And in under 3 minutes? Sigh. A better procedure then the one described above.
