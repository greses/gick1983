In his first novel, ‰ÛÏFire Chief; The Story of a Volunteer Firefighter,‰Û author Ed Daniels recalls his life as a volunteer firefighter in the mountains of Colorado. Based on actual events, the book takes readers into the heat which countless volunteer firefighters face every day throughout the world. Most people don‰Ûªt realize that the majority of the firefighters, EMTs and Paramedics who respond to fires and accidents in rural areas are volunteers. These First Responders sacrifice time with their families and their careers, responding at a moment‰Ûªs notice to protect the lives and property of those who need them. While he fictionalizes his characters and locations, ‰ÛÏFire Chief‰Û describes Daniels‰Ûª actual experiences and encounters in frightening detail. He relates stories of house fires, wildfires, car accidents and back country rescues as they really happened. We gain insight into what was going through his mind, his emotions and his reactions as he responded to horrific incidents sometimes involving family and friends. Woven throughout his emergency encounters, Daniels describes what it is like for a volunteer fire chief trying to balance the load of raising a family, handling a career, and leading a team of sometimes unruly volunteers. Readers go along for the journey as he grows into an expert leader who eventually retires, and reflects on his lifetime of bravery and public service.
