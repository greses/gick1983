In his first novel, _岩Fire Chief; The Story of a Volunteer Firefighter,_ author Ed Daniels recalls his life as a volunteer firefighter in the mountains of Colorado. Based on actual events, the book takes readers into the heat which countless volunteer firefighters face every day throughout the world. Most people don_验t realize that the majority of the firefighters, EMTs and Paramedics who respond to fires and accidents in rural areas are volunteers. These First Responders sacrifice time with their families and their careers, responding at a moment_验s notice to protect the lives and property of those who need them. While he fictionalizes his characters and locations, _岩Fire Chief_ describes Daniels_验 actual experiences and encounters in frightening detail. He relates stories of house fires, wildfires, car accidents and back country rescues as they really happened. We gain insight into what was going through his mind, his emotions and his reactions as he responded to horrific incidents sometimes involving family and friends. Woven throughout his emergency encounters, Daniels describes what it is like for a volunteer fire chief trying to balance the load of raising a family, handling a career, and leading a team of sometimes unruly volunteers. Readers go along for the journey as he grows into an expert leader who eventually retires, and reflects on his lifetime of bravery and public service. Daniels said. _岩I want others to be inspired to volunteer and to see for themselves what life is like as a First Responder. People should have a better understanding of what their neighbors and friends are experiencing as volunteer firefighters, EMTs and Paramedics._",Good,"We used to sing it together at a karaoke bar called Same Same But Different during our J1 summer in New York, her on lead vocals, me on backing.

This fortress had many roads leading to it. A general and his army wanted to take over the fortress and defeat the dictator. However, there were small mines buried along every single road leading to this fortress. If the general sent his entire army down one road, the mines would explode, killing his army and destroying neighboring villages. He decides to instead break his army up into small groups and send each group down a separate road headed towards the fortress. The general successfully got his army to the fortress and overthrew the dictator.","A barn on a farm was up in flames, and the neighboring community tried to help put out the fire before it spread. Luckily, the barn was right next to a lake. All of the neighbors had buckets and were taking turns dousing the flames with water. However, only small amounts of water were hitting the flames at once and it didn't seem to be doing anything, and the house next to the barn seemed likely to catch on fire. Then the fire chief shows up, and he orders everyone to fill up their buckets at once. They wait for the last person to fill their bucket, and the chief orders them all to douse the flames with their buckets of water at the same time, successfully putting the fire out.
